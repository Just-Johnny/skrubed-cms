  Launching a new site with new tools.

So I've recently switched over to VS Code as my primary editor. I'd been using Atom for a couple of years and before that, Dreamweaver and long before that, Notepad. It's not a big leap between VS Code &amp; Atom but Atom was running a bit sluggish on my machine and there were some out of the box features I really dug with VS Code. The main feature I'm enjoying is the built in bash terminal, something Atom lacked, at least as a default feature.

It's a bit funny to me, to see how popular terminals have become. They can be very powerful if you can remember all the commands or keep a cheatsheet next to you, but it almost feels like a regression. Something reminiscent of the DOS days. Not something I personally miss. However, I do find myself running ```npm install <something cool>``` or ```yarn start``` to initialize this particular project.

## What is this project?

 Ideally, this will serve as my portfolio website as well as a place to write on topics such as this. I'd also like to share good content I find across the web with a heavy focus on web development. The site is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlify.com/). The two have been combined to allow for ease of updates to Netlify's hosting which is pulling flat files from my [Github account](https://github.com/Just-Johnny/skrubed-cms).

## Why am I building this?

The ultimate goal here is to get a new website off the ground while learning about other potential technologies available to myself and  clients. I currently have a Wordpress site I developed and while I'm pleased with the overall design, the speed and hosting have not been up to my standards. After running a speedtest on the default Hugo CMS, I was sold on giving it a go. One thing I was not keen on was the class naming system, so rather than use the baked in CSS that comes with Hugo, I've replaced it with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). What can I say? I like class naming systems that are easy to read. If I have a class wrapper that looks like this, ```f5 w-100 hover-bg-light-gray hover-accent-color-light fw8```, I am not going to be a happy camper.

## What's next?

Things are always changing. While I will undoubtedly keep this site for some time, I will continue to test out other platforms in hopes of finding a true replacement to Wordpress. It's just become such an unwieldy beast over the years and there's so much overhead, it would be great to see a lightweight option. My short time with Hugo has led me to the realization that it's great if you're a developer, but I do not see a client ever wanting to work on the platform. I don't think it's intended for the average user and that's okay because I'm not the average user.
